HOW TO RUN:

On Linux:
  cd into the run directory and run by typing ./linux_output.  If it
  does not work, you may have to recompile which may be done by changing into
  the LinuxBuild directory and running "build" (./build)

On Windows:
  cd into the run directory and run by typing 'win_output' or 'win_output.exe'.  If it
  does not work, you may have to recompile which may be done by changing into
  the WindowsBuild directory and running "build.bat" (build or build.bat)

On Mac:
  on mac, you will have to build it from scratch.  This can be done by
  cd into the MacBuild directory and running build (./build). After that, the
  build script will prompt you to run the file, and you could also go to the run
  directory and run mac_output.



HOW TO USE:
  instructions are available in the command line interface by typing 'h' or
  'help'.

  You can search by typing 'search'. Then, the document rankings will be given.
  If your query did not meet the threshold T, then you will see a message saying
  which words were gotten from the knowledge base and appended to your query.
